> Wave is a reactive programming library powered by the [Wonka](https://github.com/0no-co/wonka) library that seamlessly combines React hooks with the robustness of RxJS-like operators and creators. It bridges the gap between React's declarative approach and the functional reactive programming paradigm.

Wave provides a comprehensive set of hooks to bring the power of reactive programming to your React applications seamlessly. With Wave, you can easily create reactive updates for your UI components based on changing data streams. Whether you're building a simple or complex React app, Wave can help you create a highly responsive and interactive UI.
